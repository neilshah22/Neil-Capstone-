PROJECT TITLE: Button Panel
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: AP Computer Scienece Capstone
VERSION or DATE: 5/11/16
AUTHORS: Neil Shah

Overview: This project depolys a window with multiple buttons for different sounds. you
can choose and click a button and the program will play a sounds as and each button has specific
sound attached to it. Every time you hit the button the sound will play and stop, or if you hit the button 
while something else is playing, that sound will stop and the program will play the sound of the new button 
pressed. 

This capstone features buttons that we learned how to create eariler this semester, 
also I used recurrsion so that you can click the button as many times as you want
and the sound repeats itself. I also had to use the case and brake method to 
inplement sound for the buttons. Some of the things I had to research was how
to bring sound into the code and implement it in a button. Another method I
had to research was how to stop the sound and repeat it everytime you hit the 
button.

There are two steps in running my program, very difficult steps:
    1) Deploy code
    2) push buttons
